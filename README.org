* Requirements: Prelude

This library is the contents of the =personal= folder for configuring emacs when using the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]] library for EMACS by bbatsov Bozhidar Batsov.

The path for this folder for a standard installation of EMACS should be:

: ~/.emacs.d/personal

* Installation

** 1: Download this library
Get this library by running this command on a shell terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/iani/emacs-prelude-personal.git
#+END_SRC

This will create a folder emacs-prelude-personal at the location where you ran the command. 

** 2: Link the folder of this library to your .emacs.d folder

Then link the library to your prelude personal folder by running the following commands. 

*Take care to edit =/full/path/to= to correspond to the actual location of =emacs-prelude-personal= as you downloaded it with =git -clone=.*

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Rename previous personal folder to personal + current date and time:
mv ~/.emacs.d/personal ~/.emacs.d/"personal-`date`"
# link downloaded library to personal folder: 
ln -s /full/path/to/emacs-prelude-personal ~/.emacs.d/personal
#+END_SRC

** 3. Restart emacs
